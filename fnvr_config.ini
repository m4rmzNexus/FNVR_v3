; Adjust these values to fine-tune controller position and rotation

[Position]
; Scale factor for converting meters to game units
PositionScale = 50.0

; Offsets applied after scaling (in game units)
PositionOffsetX = 15.0
PositionOffsetY = -10.0
PositionOffsetZ = 0.0

[Rotation]
; Scale factors for rotation axes
RotationScalePitch = -120.0
RotationScaleYaw = 1.0
RotationScaleRoll = 120.0

; Rotation offsets (in degrees)
RotationOffsetPitch = 10.0
RotationOffsetYaw = 0.0
RotationOffsetRoll = -75.0

[Debug]
; Set to 1 to log raw values to console
LogRawValues = 0

; Notes:
; - Positive X = Right
; - Positive Y = Forward (in game)
; - Positive Z = Up
; - Adjust PositionScale if weapon appears too close/far
; - Adjust offsets to center the weapon properly
